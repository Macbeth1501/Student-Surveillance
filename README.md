# ScholarWatch: AI-Powered Student Surveillance System  


*Real-time monitoring for academic integrity*  

## 📌 Problem Statement  
In exam halls and classrooms, manual monitoring of students for malpractice (e.g., smartphone usage, peeking at neighbors) is inefficient and prone to human error. Traditional CCTV systems lack automated analysis, requiring constant staff attention. An AI-powered surveillance solution is needed to **detect suspicious activities in real-time**, ensuring academic integrity while reducing reliance on human invigilators.  

## ✨ Features  
- **📱 Smartphone Detection**: Flags unauthorized phone usage.  
- **👁️ Face Recognition**: Verifies student identity and tracks attention.  
- **🔄 Posture/Gesture Recognition**: Detects suspicious movements (e.g., glancing at neighbors).  
- **🚨 Real-time Alerts**: Notifies invigilators via audio/visual cues.
